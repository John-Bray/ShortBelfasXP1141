# Short Brothers Belfast
 Short Belfast for X-Plane
 
This was created and saved in X-Plane 11.41 but should work with all versions of X-Plane 11.

The Short Belfast was a heavy lift turboprop freighter that was built by British manufacturer Short Brothers at Belfast. Only 10 aircraft were constructed, all of which entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), who operated it under the designation Short Belfast C.1.

RAF service was from 1966 to 1976. TAC HeavyLift purchased five retired RAF Belfasts for commercial use in 1977 and operated three of them from 1980. Currently, one Belfast is on display at the RAF Museum Cosford. A Belfast formerly operated by Heavylift Cargo is lying abandoned at Cairns Airport in Australia.

Thanks to Jacques Brault for the inspiration which led me to create a new version of it and to Sean McLeod for his input on the flight model.  It is far from perfect but hopefully flyable.
